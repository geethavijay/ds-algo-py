## Sorts

The following sorts are implemented:

1. `bubble_sort()`
2. `bucket_sort()`
3. `insertion_sort()`
4. `merge_sort()`
5. `quick_sort()`
6. `selection_sort()`

On testing with uniform random numbers from 0 - 10000 in a data set of size 10000, 
here are the results:

```
Time taken by quick_sort for 10000 random numbers is 0.031214 sec
Time taken by merge_sort for 10000 random numbers is 0.053476 sec
Time taken by bucket_sort for 10000 random numbers is 0.697489 sec
Time taken by selection_sort for 10000 random numbers is 3.429744 sec
Time taken by bubble_sort for 10000 random numbers is 6.415863 sec
Time taken by insertion_sort for 10000 random numbers is 7.523072 sec
```
